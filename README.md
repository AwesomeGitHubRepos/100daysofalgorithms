# 100daysofalgorithms

Hello! I'm Daniel Sada. I'm trying to do an algorithm or two a day or at least try to solve a problem a day. I'll be alternating between new algorithms and working in problems with those algorithms. I'm also fairly new with python, and I want to get aquaintanced with Python3.

# Running unit tests.

Clone the project, then run:

```
python3 -m unittest discover algorithms/test -p '*.py'
```
